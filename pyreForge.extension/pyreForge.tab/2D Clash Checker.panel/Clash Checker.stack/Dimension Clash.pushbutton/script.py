Description:
This script detects and selects annotations (dimensions and text 
notes) in the active view that overlap with wall elements.
__________________________________________________________________
How-to:
1.The script will analyze the active view, detecting any 
overlaps between annotations and wall elements.
2.Annotations that overlap with walls will be highlighted in 
the active view.
3. A message dialog will appear, informing you of the number 
of overlapping annotations detected.
