__________________________________________________________________
Description:
This script identifies and deletes overlapping dimensions in the active view of Autodesk Revit.
It compares the bounding boxes of all dimensions and retains one copy of each overlapping set, 
deleting the others. The remaining dimensions are selected and displayed for the user.
__________________________________________________________________
How-to:
1. Run the script.
2. The script will check for overlapping dimensions in the active view.
3. The first occurrence of each overlapping set will be retained, and others will be deleted.
4. A success message will confirm the number of dimensions retained.
__________________________________________________________________
Last update:
- [22.01.2025] - v1.1.0 Added orientation check to prevent overlapping of vertical and horizontal dimensions
- [14.01.2025] - v1.0.0 Initial release
